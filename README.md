# Croco - Pocket Vending Machine

Mobile Application for Vending Machine.
Developed for ATLAS Hackathon 2021, using Flutter and Firebase.

## Motivation

Ever feel the trouble of looking for vending machine to quench your thirst? Not to mention when you found one, the beverages you are looking for is not available.
Moreover, when you tried to pay, the machine just decided to reject your money, or give back your changes in coins.

With that being said, our objective here is to bring user's ease of use when using vending machine. User will be able to check the nearest vending machine, and also the stocks that it has. Route will be generated for user from user's current location to the desired vending machine. User can also purchase the goods using the app beforehand, and pick it up by scanning QR Code. This way, users can preserved their goods before it is out of stock.

This app also introduce e-wallet, so there will be no hassle in looking for paper money, or getting coins as change. In addition to support recycling movement, users could recycle their item by throwing their waste into a specified container and gain points that could be changed to discount coupons. The container will be built with Image Recognition system, to recognize whether the waste is recycable. If it is recycable, then points will be given.
